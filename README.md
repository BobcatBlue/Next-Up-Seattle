<h2> Seattle Local Music web app</h2>
<p>This is a web app built with Flask that will show people which bands and music acts
are playing in Seattle tonight, and at which venues.</p>
<p>It pulls the earliest event from a venue's calendar, so even if no one is playing
at that venue tonight, it will show you the next show there.</p>
<p>Right now the list of venues is only populated by referencing the calendars on 
ticketing websites, but soon I will try to add other venues one-by-one via scraping
their calendars.</p>
<p>If you want to use this code for your own city, you'll want to sign up to get a 
TicketMaster API key to make the API calls, and also go to their documenation pages
to get the venue codes you will need (see Listed_Venues.csv for reference).</p>
<p>My hope is that eventually, I'll be able to build this out so there is not just a list
of venues, but the users will be able to toggle over to a map of the city with 
little markers showing approx. venue locations with a little box that pops up when the 
marker is clicked, showing the next calendar event at that venue.</p>
<p>I'd also like to have options for users to quickly hear the bands music or see 
genre info.</p>
